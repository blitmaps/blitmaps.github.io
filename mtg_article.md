# rEDH: a feeble attempt at balancing commander, in the spirit of cEDH.
### by Brad Pearce, Aug 2024

## Update Jul 2025
Wizards of the coast has implemented a very similar proposal as this article, with 'Game Changers'.

## TL;DR

I'm proposing a set of house rules, that could potentially be used in Commander to make the games more fun, for a mixed 
play group, and less repetitive.  The format should be robust enough to accommodate horrible people like me, and wholesome 
people who want, and frankly deserve, to be able to cast their 'Bruenor Battlehammer' in peace.

I propose placing an additional restriction on deck-building: players may have up to 1 'Reserved List', and up to 1 'Power List'
card in their deck.  The lists are exclusive, so cards like 'Grim Monolith', while powerful are on the 'Reserved List'.
So most decks will want a Reserved and Power card.

## An intro to the problem

Commander is a completely overpowered format, which leads to dramatic and fun games in many cases.
One of the great achievements of the cEDH community is the agreement that everyone is there to win.  There really
isn't an issue with being 'unfun' or making another player sad, in fact, tears are encouraged by many veteran play groups.
There exists a metagame, in which you know (mostly) what cards, and decks to expect, and who you need to beat.  This leads
to interesting sub-games.  

Any departure from this contract, means that you have to have some conception as of "what do I expect?".  You might play 
creature removal because you expect to see creatures, and that removal will depend on whether you need it early or late.
You'll be guessing, because you've got no objective benchmark of what to beat.  Instead of expecting a turn 2 Dockside
extortionist after a round of fast mana, you might be expecting 'Elves' or a hexproof creature on turn 6.

What I am trying to say is, as soon as we step away from this objective measure, 
we enter the realm of vague metrics of fair play, and sporting conduct.  Everyone instinctively knows the issues here, 
to illustrate: Timmy has turned up with his 
Dinosaur-Pirate-Squid "SeaKings" deck, and has declared it a 'Power 7-9', despite it being two precons shuffled together, 
and the single most expensive, flashy card is removed for 1 white mana and gaining timmy 8 life. It has cards you 
have never seen, and most notably... Timmy is going to die (To the sweet smell of smokestacks).

Now, it is very hard to legislate away all the powerful cards, or indeed get rid of very mean people like me, who
have spend many years playing a child's card game, and winning all the marbles.  But I think, over many games of Commander, and indeed
through playing Canadian Highlander, I have identified ways to make the games fairer, more diverse, and most importantly, 
more fun.

## The Fixes

### Fix 1: "Power Cards" - No, Not the Moxen.
To understand the fixes to this format, we need to go back to 1995.  At this time, there was a word used for the Power 9.  They were
referred to on mailing lists, in magazines and in person, as "Spoilers".  They spoiled games, and they were restricted,
as to do this less often.  People started to run Tutors as spare copies, and those cards that could go and get them were 
also restricted - cards like Demonic Tutor.

When a deck can contain a number of redundant pieces to push ahead on turns (such as Sol Ring, Mana Crypt etc.) and back 
that up with Demonic Tutor to go and get combo pieces, or any other set of "extra copies", any organic strategy has no chance.
'Nice army of goblins nerd, how about I just tutor for my A+B combo, and you're dead!'
Now, we don't want a massive banned list, we like playing and seeing these cards, but there should be some cost to using them. 
Canadian Highlander does this with points, which works great for creating really balanced games, but sadly warps the 
deckbuilding around your 'picks'.  But we already have an elegant system in Highlander, you only get one.  So I propose a
"Power Cards" list.  You can only have 1 card of this list in your deck, any one you want.

### Fix 2: "Reserved Cards" - Yes those ones.
As you will have guessed, I own all the cards.  Over time, Wizards have printed cards very much like the cards on the
reserved list, some very close, some occasionally upgraded.  The difficult thing is, they act like a spare copy in many instances.
If you have 1 shock land, and a full set of fetchlands to get it, you have a 45% chance of getting your land on turn 1.  If I 
have a shock and an original dual, I have 49%.  Amplify that effect for cards like "Survival of the Fittest", and other
cards with multiple similar printings and the problem becomes clear; every alternative card that is printed, actually makes
a deck containing the original more consistent and stronger.  Therefore, I would propose, that on top of the choice of 
power cards, you can have 1 card from the reserved list (that is not banned), in your deck.  While these are often very powerful,
none are listed in the Power Cards section, as they fall under the reserved cards restriction.  Limiting reserved list cards 
is mainly for the compounding, or snowballing effect of redundancy copies, rather than accessibility reasons, without a 
blanket ban on decks that need an obscure reserved list card to function.  So if you want to spend your 'slot' on Psychic Allergy... that is ok.
Cards on this list, do not feature as 'Power Cards' - even though most of them are busted.

## Conclusion

The philosophy of these lists is not to stop broken things from happening, but to both reduce the frequency and make
redundancy more difficult.  A second consequence is that knowing the lists allows the player to observe a play, such
as a turn 1 Sol Ring and know that Demonic Tutor or Ad Nauseam are not coming, because the Sol Ring is the chosen power card.

This is my idea for a more rebalanced Commander, I will refer to it as rEDH for want of a better name.  
Below are a list of what I would consider the Power Cards ([see on Moxfield](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/ONntko_QmE6wrxt5VOljnQ)), to go alongside the official(ish) Commander banned list. 
The Reserved List is well established, and can be found [here](https://scryfall.com/search?q=is%3Areserved).
