# Recent Research
A majority of my recent research is confidential, however:

I have been working with the excellent team at Parkinson's UK on automatically detecting Parkinson's Disease in brain samples; you can read about it [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.30.505459v2).

I have also been working to automatically estimate how long patients will stay in hospital, which you can read about [here](https://transform.england.nhs.uk/blogs/using-ai-to-predict-long-term-hospital-stays-an-ai-skunkworks-proof-of-concept/).

# Slayers of High Toro

During the 2019 lockdowns in the UK, I embarked on a long standing desire to make a computer game for the Commodore Amiga.  This culminated in 'Slayers of High Toro', an extension and adaptation of the game 'Slay' by Sean O'Connor.  This project was written in modern C++, and has been both very well recieved and really fun to play!  The amazing music was produced by [Drozerix](https://soundcloud.com/drozerix).

If you'd like to see some gameplay, you can see it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH0moStN-Ng).

It can also be purchased [here](https://www.bitmapsoft.co.uk/product/slayers-of-high-toro/).
