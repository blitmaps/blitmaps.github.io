# Slayers of High Toro

During the 2019 lockdowns in the UK, I embarked on a long standing desire to make a computer game for the Commodore Amiga.  This culminated in 'Slayers of High Toro', an extension and adaptation of the game 'Slay' by Sean O'Connor.  This project was written in modern C++, and has been both very well recieved and really fun to play!  The amazing music was produced by [Drozerix](https://soundcloud.com/drozerix).

If you'd like to see some gameplay, you can see it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH0moStN-Ng).

It can also be purchased [here](https://www.bitmapsoft.co.uk/product/slayers-of-high-toro/#:~:text=Slayers%20of%20High%20Toro%20is,defend%20your%20kingdoms%20from%20attack.).
